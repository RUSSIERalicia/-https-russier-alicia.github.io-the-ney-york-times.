    <h1 class="title margeGD padding_top_5">Are electric cars soon on all our streets?</h1>
    <p class="margeGD">     Nowadays, it is important to think about our daily carbon emissions. Some reduce it by 
        paying attention to their electricity or gas consumption, others by traveling by public transport, by bike 
        or even on foot. But some choose the electric car, which allows them to travel without polluting too much. 
        The EU aims to stop the sale of thermal engines in 2035, but is this possible for all countries?  For the 
        French government, the challenge is to increase their sales to reach 15% of electric vehicles by 2030.</p>
    <div class="flex centre padding_top_3"><img class="animation-image margeGD taille_50" src="images/photo_article.png" alt="voiture electrique"></div>
    <p class="margeGD padding_top_3">     To achieve this figure, for example, residents of the Auvergne Rhône Alpes 
        region have access to aid of 3,000 euros for the acquisition of an electric 
        vehicle since 2023. This article, focused on the Rhône department, will make 
        it possible to analyze several data, to make it possible to observe whether 
        the number of charging infrastructures evolves with electric cars.</p>
    <h2 class="margeGD padding_top_3">An achievable goal ?</h2>
    <p class="margeGD">     In the Rhône, from 2020 to 2024, the number of electric vehicles will increase 
        by around 2.4%, reaching 57,122 compared to 1,689,763 for other types. This market 
        is gradually starting to grow over the years. However, if we look at the graph, 
        a very strong increase in sales would be necessary to be able to reach the objective 
        of 15% in 2030.</p>
    <div class="flex centre"><svg class="taille_50 margeGD" id="graphique" width="1000" height="500"></svg></div>
    <h4 class="margeGD">Display options :</h4>
    <button class="margeGD" id="bouton">Masquer les voitures</button>
    <button class="margeGD" id="nb_voitures">Afficher nombre de voitures électriques</button>
    <p class="margeGD padding_top_3">Even if the objective seems unattainable, it would be possible to get closer by improving 
        one point: the terminals.</p>
    <h2 class="margeGD padding_top_3">Why aren't more electric cars on French roads ?</h2>
    <p class="margeGD">     92% of individuals who own one live in a private home, and 88% recharge at home. The problem 
        is obvious if we compare the number of terminals and the number of electric vehicles. Even 
        if both evolve from year to year, increased installation of terminals would be necessary to 
        meet demand. </p>
    <div class="flex centre padding_top_3"><img class="margeGD taille_50" src="images/graphique2.png" alt="graphique comparaison bornes/voitures"></div>
    <p class="margeGD padding_top_3">If we take the average of vehicles per municipality which is 205 and that of the terminals which 
        is 3, the considerable difference justifies that those residing in communities do not have them 
        due to charging problems. Which suggests that if everyone can have access to a terminal not far 
        from their place of residence, the number of electric vehicles would be much higher. All the same, 
        thanks to comparison calculations, there is a link between electric cars and charging points, the 
        municipalities with the most charging points are those where the cars are the most numerous.</p>
    <h2 class="margeGD padding_top_3">Is the distribution of terminals fair ?</h2>
    <p class="margeGD">	    Finally, are the location of terminals and the number of charging points linked? The Rhône has 
        a total of 852 charging points, for an average of 3 charging points per municipality. Most often the
         terminals are located on the road which has 139 different locations. Public car parks come last with 
         only 6 locations throughout the department. Thanks to the correlation ratio (between 1 and 0) between 
         these two variables, it is possible to say whether there is a link (close to 1) or not (close to 0). 
         The result obtained is 0.07. The numbers of charging points are therefore not linked to their locations. 
         These are therefore decided by the person who sets it up, no slice is given depending on the location.</p>
    <div class="flex centre padding_top_3"><img class="margeGD taille_50" src="images/borne.png" alt="photo_bornes"></div>
    <h2 class="margeGD padding_top_3">Asmall conclusion from our analysis</h2>
    <p class="margeGD">     To conclude, the advancement of electric cars is very slow, the objective of 15% of these vehicles by 
        2030 is not currently achievable, due to the lack of infrastructure which is very minimal compared to the 
        number of vehicles, even if they increase over the years. Also, people living in collective residences are 
        hampered by this lack of terminals, which limits the purchase of electric vehicles. So to optimize their 
        development, the installation of many more terminals is necessary. So is a 100% electric target for 2050 
        too ambitious or achievable?</p>
